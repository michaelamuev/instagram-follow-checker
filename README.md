Python scripting can make life a lot easier when it comes to automating repetitive daily tasks that eat up hours of your week. Itâ€™s great for digging through data, spotting patterns, and pulling out insights that help drive decisiong making. But sometimes, itâ€™s just as useful for checking if your ex-girlfriendâ€™s dogâ€™s Instagram page still follows you.

# what this script does
This script compares your Instagram followers and following lists from the official JSON data export (instructions below) and tells you who isnâ€™t following you back.

# how it does this?
1. The script Reads both files (followers, and following) and extracts usernames from each.

2. Compares them to find accounts you follow that donâ€™t follow you back.

3. Prints that list right in your terminal.

4. In short: two files go in, three lists come out â€” followers, following, and the painful truth.
